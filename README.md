# IEEE SSCS Chipathon2025: MOSbius Track Documentation 
In this repository you will find the main documentation associated with the MOSbius track for the [IEEE SSCS Chipathon 2025](https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-chipathon-2025/)

## MOSbius Track Resources

- [Brief Overview of the MOSbius Track](./files/MOSbius_Chipathon_2025_kinget_v1.pdf) 
-  [MOSbius website](https://mosbius.org)

- [MOSbius Chipathon 2025 Documentation (this repo)](https://github.com/mosbiuschip/chipathon2025)

- [GF180 Analog Design Workflow GitHub Repo Template](https://github.com/Jianxun/iic-osic-tools-project-template) is a template for creating your project file repository on GitHub (see [CAD_tool_installation](./CAD_tool_installation/install_using_repo.md))


## Structure of This Documentation Repository

- [`CAD_tool_installation`](./CAD_tool_installation/README.md) has installation instructions for the CAD tools.
- [`CAD_tool_computing_constellation`](./CAD_tool_computing_constellation/README.md) gives an overview how the tools are being run on your computer.
- [`CAD_tool_flow`](./CAD_tool_flow/README.md) explains the various CAD tools, their input and output files, and how they interact.

## Creating Your GitHub Repository for Your Design Files

- To create the GitHub repository for your design files so you can collaborate among your team, you can create a new repository from the [GF180 Analog Design Workflow GitHub Repo Template](https://github.com/Jianxun/iic-osic-tools-project-template).
- The template has a suggested folder structure, as well as an example of a small design of a five-transistor operational transconductance amplifier (5T-OTA) including schematics and layout.
