## Documentation Resources

-  [MOSbius Website](https://mosbius.org)

- [MOSbius Chipathon 2025 Documentation (this repo)](https://github.com/mosbiuschip/chipathon2025) has documentation, installation instructions, and technology information. 

    - [`gf180mcuD_technology_info`](./gf180mcuD_technology_info/README.md) has information  about the GF180 technology gf180mcuD and links to design examples.
    - [`CAD_tool_computing_constellation`](./CAD_tool_computing_constellation/README.md) gives an overview how the tools are being run on your computer.
    - [`CAD_tool_flow`](./CAD_tool_flow/README.md) explains the various CAD tools, their input and output files, and how they interact.
    - [`CAD_tool_installation`](./CAD_tool_installation/README.md) has installation instructions for the open-source IC CAD tools.

## Creating Your GitHub Repository for Your Design Files

- To create the GitHub repository for your design files so you can collaborate among your team, use [GF180 Analog Design Project Template Repo](https://github.com/Jianxun/iic-osic-tools-project-template) as a template for creating your project file repository on GitHub (see also in [CAD_tool_installation](./CAD_tool_installation/install_using_repo.md))

- The template has a suggested folder structure, as well as an example of a small design of a five-transistor operational transconductance amplifier (5T-OTA) including schematics and layout. 
- This template is part of the [installation instructions (simplest version)](./CAD_tool_installation/install_using_repo.md).
