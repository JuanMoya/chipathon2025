# CAD Tool Installation Instructions

The installation of the CAD tools can be done in many different ways. Here we propose a constellation that is as simple as possible for beginning designers (with limited linux experience).

In parallel with the installation instructions, take a look at the [CAD Tool Computing Constellation](../CAD_tool_computing_constellation/README.md) so you get a sense of how all the pieces fit together. 

## Installation using a GitHub project repo (simplest)

## Instructions (more detailed)

- [Windows](windows.md)
- [MacOS](macos.md)

- [Klayout & GF180](../klayout_pcells/README.md) (under construction)
