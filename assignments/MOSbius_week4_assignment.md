# MOSbius Track: Week 4 Assignment

July 6, 2025

This week, please continue the activities lined out in the [Week 3 Assignment](https://github.com/mosbiuschip/chipathon2025/blob/main/assignments/MOSbius_week3_assignment.md), also posted above, but make sure to put full focus on the **proposal development**. Friday you will be presenting your proposal.

Often the question is asked about a template. And now, there is a good [example of a proposal](https://github.com/JorgeMarinN/SSCS-Chipathon-2025_AC3E-Chile-team/tree/main/proposal), right here here in the chat, in the post before this one.

There is still an outline of the proposal in the week 3 MOSbius slides ([here](https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-chipathon-2025/tree/main/schedule) and [here](https://github.com/mosbiuschip/chipathon2025/tree/main)). The format is quite open ended, feel free to adjust to what your project needs.

Please send links to your proposal -- even early drafts -- a.s.a.p. to the mentors so we can give you feedback. Remember, _"The early bird gets the worm."_
