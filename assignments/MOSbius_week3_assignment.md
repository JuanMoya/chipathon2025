# MOSbius Track: Week 3 Assignment

June 28, 2025

We would like you to focus on the following activities this week, *in order of priority*:

- Team formation – make sure you are part of a team, if you are having trouble finding a team through `fossi-chat` let us know. The goal is for everyone to be part of a team by **July 5th, 2025**  
- Start Chip Proposal  
  - On **July 11, 2025** you will have your proposal review, so you need to begin drafting your proposal as soon as possible. There is an outline of the proposal in the *Week 3 MOSbius slides* ([here](https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-chipathon-2025/tree/main/schedule) and [here (slide 31)](https://github.com/mosbiuschip/chipathon2025/blob/main/files/MOSbius_Chipathon_2025_tutorial_kinget_v1.pdf)). The format is quite open ended, feel free to adjust to what your project needs.   
  - Send out links to *draft* proposals to the mentors using `fossi-chat` so we can start giving early feedback so you have a strong proposal to present.  
- Practice using the design tools  
  - By now, you should have installed the tools and ran some simulations and looked at some layouts.   
    - [Chipaton installation Instructions](https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-chipathon-2025/tree/main/resources/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS) & [Additional installation information](https://github.com/mosbiuschip/chipathon2025/blob/main/CAD_tool_installation/README.md)   
    - Review [these examples](https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-chipathon-2025/tree/main/examples/analog_tutorial)   
    - Familiarize yourself with [how the tools are organized](https://github.com/mosbiuschip/chipathon2025/blob/main/CAD_tool_flow/README.md) and [how the various software pieces work together](https://github.com/mosbiuschip/chipathon2025/blob/main/CAD_tool_computing_constellation/README.md)  
- Practice using Git with your team  
  - Take a look at the [GF180 Analog Design Project Template Repo](https://github.com/Jianxun/iic-osic-tools-project-template), also discussed [here](https://github.com/mosbiuschip/chipathon2025/tree/main), and practice with your team how you can collaborate on a design. (Different team members should create branches and pull requests, and the team lead should merge everything regularly into the main branch.)   
  - The [GF180 Analog Design Project Template Repo](https://github.com/Jianxun/iic-osic-tools-project-template) also has information on how to organize your analog libraries and an example circuit.   
- Review the GF180 Process  
  - Take a look [at this brief summary](https://github.com/mosbiuschip/chipathon2025/blob/main/gf180mcuD_technology_info/README.md).  
  - A good practice is to study the gm/ID plots of the nMOS and pMOS transistor; review the [Gm-over-ID Characterization](https://github.com/mosbiuschip/chipathon2025/blob/main/gf180mcuD_technology_info/devices.md) and try to replicate it.   
- Learn Git, Linux CLI, …   
  - If you are not familiar with Git or Linux command line, take some online tutorials. If you find good ones, share them on fossi-chat.
